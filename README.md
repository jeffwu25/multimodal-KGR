# multimodal-KGR

Code for implementing multimodal spatiotemporal modeling with kernel graph regression (KGR) and copula models

Authors: Jeffrey Wu, Gareth W Peters (UCSB)

In this project, we develop a novel, low complexity framework for modeling spatiotemporal multimodal data. The utility of this framework is demonstrated with a case study involving jointly modeling the daily excess number of deaths due to heat and the corresponding average maximum air temperature across the nine regions of England during the summer months (June-Sept) of 2018. The overarching research question for this project is: does the inclusion of a copula function to model the dependence between modalities lead to improved forecasts compared to marginal forecasts made with KGR models? This paper focuses on a two
modality problem, but the proposed framework can easily be extended to more modalities.
